> "Intelligence is a way to maximize the capture of possible future histories of a particular system." (c) [Alex Wissner-Gross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Wissner-Gross)

I am recent graduate with a Master of Science in Computer Science from one of the biggest University in Russia. I has developed some useful apps when I was studying. Some of these are described in [Portfolio](/portfolio/). I've interested in DevOps theme lately. An idea of automation of everything is inspiring me. 

Currently, I am working as a DevOps engineer and trying to learn as much about CI/CD along the way and applying it to accelerate a developing of software in IT Company in Perm.

When not at work I enjoy running, bicycling and hiking. 

My old site is [The GRomR1 Blog](http://gromr1.blogspot.ru).
